# README: MATLAB Robotics Simulation Project

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the simulation and analysis of robotic mechanisms using MATLAB. It contains a variety of MATLAB scripts designed to explore different aspects of robotics, such as kinematics, Jacobian matrices, and motion simulation. These scripts are instrumental for students, educators, and researchers interested in the theoretical and practical aspects of robotic motion.

## Project Contents

Each script and document in this repository serves a specific purpose within the realm of robotics simulation:

- **DexterJacobianMatrix.m**: MATLAB script for computing the Jacobian matrix of the Dexter robot arm, which is essential for understanding the relationship between joint velocities and end-effector velocities.
  
- **InverseKinematicsFiveDof.m**: This script is used to calculate the inverse kinematics for a robot with five degrees of freedom, allowing the determination of joint configurations that achieve desired end-effector positions.
  
- **QNine.m** and **QNineSimulation.m**: These scripts are designed for running simulations of the QNine robot model, focusing on specific tasks and scenarios to visualize the robot's performance and capabilities.
  
- **RRR.m** and **RRR1.m**: MATLAB scripts for simulating a basic RRR (Revolute-Revolute-Revolute) joint configuration, useful for educational demonstrations of simple articulated robotic arms.
  
- **Robotic_Models_MATLAB_Coding.pdf**: A comprehensive guide that discusses the MATLAB coding implementations for various robotic models explored in the scripts. This document serves as the theoretical backbone for the practical applications demonstrated in the scripts.
  
- **robotMotionInSpace.m**: A script dedicated to simulating the motion of a robot in a three-dimensional space, which helps in visualizing how robots interact with their environment.
  
- **stanfordExample.m**: MATLAB script based on the Stanford arm example, illustrating more complex kinematic chains and their computations.

## Software Requirements

To run the scripts provided in this repository, you will need:

- **MATLAB**: Ensure that you have a recent version of MATLAB installed, as all scripts are written in MATLAB and utilize its various toolboxes. The Robotics System Toolbox is particularly recommended for full functionality.
